method: String padString(String input, String length) ALTERNATIVES
    Alternative Approach: Store Length Separately, so far we have used a padString method in com.binaryGenerator.AddressRecord.java
    Instead of fixed-length strings, we could store:

    An integer for length (e.g., 4 bytes).
        The actual string.
        But this makes seeking records harder, since each record might be of a different size.

Any thoughts?
